major drawbacks of jdbc is 
*******************************
1.Complexity(due to code size)

In the jdbc project , we needs to write a lot of code to map the object model’s data representation to the schema of the relational model.
Hibernate maps the object model’s data to the schema of the database itself with the help of annotations.

2.Portability

jdbc is database dependent i.e. one needs to write different codes for different database.
Whereas Hibernate is database independent and same code can work for many databases with minor changes.

3.Creating associations

Creating associations between relations is quite hard in JDBC.	
Associations like one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many can be acquired easily with the help of annotations.
